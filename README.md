# TicTacToe with Windsurf AI

A simple Tic-tac-toe implementation that serves as an experiment in AI-assisted software development. This project was created to explore the capabilities of agentic AI in Windsurf IDE, demonstrating how hobbyist coders can leverage AI to build functional applications.

## Project Context

This game was developed as a learning exercise to:
- Test the workflow of coding with an AI agent
- Understand the collaborative potential between human developers and AI
- Create a working web-based game from scratch
- Experience modern software development practices with AI assistance

## Tech Stack

- HTML/CSS for the game interface
- JavaScript for game logic
- Built with assistance from Windsurf's Cascade AI agent

## Development Experience

This project serves as a practical example of how hobbyist developers can use AI-assisted development to:
- Break down complex tasks into manageable steps
- Get real-time guidance on implementation details
- Learn best practices through hands-on development
- Quickly prototype and iterate on features

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for your own AI-assisted development projects!
